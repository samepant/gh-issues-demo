# Graphql and Typescript demo
This repo is a little test app for fetching and displaying github issues for the Cosmos-sdk. 

It uses [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/), [Graphql](https://graphql.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs) and React.

## Getting Started
Clone the repo and install the dependencies with with `npm install`

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## Directory Structure
It's an ejected `create-react-app`, so `/config` and `/scripts` contain the config (webpack, etc.) and script running files.

### `/src/` Project source
`/src/components` - React components
`/src/lib` - libraries and utilities, most notably the Apollo client and queries
`/src/types` â€” contains type definitions
